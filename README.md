#  DateSlider

A SwiftUI slider that lets you select a date (or an object that exposes its date) from a collection of dates.

### Motivation

Have you ever wanted to select a specific dated object from some collection you have? Or identify one in a list so you can scroll to it? The existing SwiftUI DatePicker is great for picking a date from a calendar, but when you want to be able to pick a specific date, it really doesn't cut it.

### Status

This version is very much a work in progress, but I thought I'd make it public while sorting out the details. The current version only only works as a horizontal slider, whereas I'd also like to support something more like the vertical slider you use with the Contacts app.
